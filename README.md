# SugarByte

SugarByte is essentially a satellite-based web application that focuses on crop fertilizer surveillance. This project is supervised by Dr.Yuri Shendryk, who is a member of working at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). This project particularly has significance on the preservation of the Great Barrier Reef, one of the significant symbol of Australia, which prevents the Great Barrie Reef from bleaching by excessive use of fertilizer. 

## Code Guide

The code is divided into five parts which are owner, writer, reader, examples and archive according to the usage and our target audience. At present, there are no accessible repositories in folders named owner, reader and archive. Therefore, we are mainly giving an introduction of writer folder and examples in detail.

As for the folder named writer, this is where we write the code to implement these features as we expect. The folder named bin which locates in users folder consists of ui_widgets, app, cloud_masking and so on. These files in bin folder are all about how to achieve features such as linking image to time-series. For instance, the file named app is where we can start running this application. And there are functions which show the outline and current soil layer of the selected paddock in the file called paddock_outliner.

With regard to examples, this folder consists of eleven files which are basic data structures in Google Earth Engine. And there are some detailed functions and how to use them in every file. For example, the file named Normalized Difference is about what normalized difference is and how to compute Normalized Difference Vegetation Index by using this function. So the readers are able to be familiar with Google Earth Engine through these examples.
